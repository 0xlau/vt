# Introduction

## Motivation

[Next Vue's documentation](https://staging.vuejs.org/) is very cool, which is built by `@vue/theme` and [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) —— A next-generation SSG for Vue ecosystem, but currently VitePress is still in early stage and there is no plugin system.

I made this theme to combine eXperience of `@vue/theme` and [current huge VuePress ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress/), also introducing some extra features like **default full text-search**, **i18n** etc.

## Features

- **Full-text search**: No server dependencies, support distinguishing locales.
- TypeScript Support
- i18n
- TOC (Table of Contents)
- Code Copy
- Sidebar
- Navbar
- Fully compatible with [VuePress's Default Theme Config](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html).

# vuepress-theme-vt

A VuePress theme inspired by `@vue/theme`, fully compatible with VuePress default theme.

## Motivation

[Next Vue's documentation](https://staging.vuejs.org/) is very cool, which is powered by [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and `@vue/theme` —— A next-generation SSG for Vue ecosystem, but currently VitePress is still in early stage and there is no plugin system.

I made this theme to combine eXperience of `@vue/theme` and [current huge VuePress ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress/), and introducing some extra features like default full text search, i18n etc.


## Features

- Full-text search (No server dependencies, support distinguishing locales)
- Code Copy
- i18n
- Sidebar
- Navbar
- TOC (Table of Contents)
- Fully compatible with [VuePress's Default Theme Config](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html).

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (Optional)\*


## Quick Start

The fastest way to use this theme is to use our [create-vt generator](https://github.com/vuepressjs/create-vuepress-site/), which will help scaffold a basic VuePress site with this theme for you.

To use it, open up your terminal in the desired directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm create vt [optionalDirectoryName]
```

The command will interactively ask for details to configure your VuePress siteâ€™s metadata such as:

- Project Name
- Description
- Maintainer Email
- Maintainer Name

To see it in action, navigate into newly scaffolded directory, install the dependencies and start the local server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

# vuepress-theme-vuejs

> A VuePress implementation for VitePress theme `@vue/theme`, fully compatible with VuePress default theme.

## Motivation

[Next Vue's Documentation](https://staging.vuejs.org/) is very cool, which is powered by [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and `@vue/theme` —— A next-generation SSG for Vue ecosystem, but currently VitePress is still in early stage and there is no plugin system.

I made this theme to combine eXperience of `@vue/theme` and [current huge VuePress ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress/).

## Features

- Full-text search (Support distinguishing locales)
- Table of Contents
- Code Copy
- Fully compatible with [VuePress's Default Theme Config](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html).

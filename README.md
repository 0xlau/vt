# vuepress-theme-vuejs

> A VuePress implementation for VitePress theme `@vue/theme`, fully compatible with VuePress default theme.

## Motivation

[Next Vue's Documentation](https://staging.vuejs.org/) is very cool, which is powered by [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and `@vue/theme` —— A next-generation SSG for Vue ecosystem, but currently VitePress is still in early stage and there is no plugin system and ecology.

I made this theme to combine `@vue/theme` and [current huge VuePress ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress/) with next .
